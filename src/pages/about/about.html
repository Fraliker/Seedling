	<p> Seedling is a game-like app in which the user “levels up” after completing certain tasks meant to improve mental health. Through Seedling, users will be provided with tasks meant to help them gradually return to a healthy mental state. They can select one of three bundles, or themes, of tasks to chose from. They will receive awards for completing tasks, in the form of leveling up, inspirational quotes, and calming photographs. These awards will provide reason for users to continue using the app and working toward a healthier mental state. Users will receive notifications that will give them affirmation and encourage them to continue through the task list if they have not used the app for a couple of days. In addition, Seedling provides information on how to reach professionals who know how to help those facing mental health issues should a user need professional help. </p>

<p> While Seedling is meant for use by anyone struggling with a mental health disorder, one of our target audiences is students who are struggling with depression. Students of all ages, especially those in high school and college, face stress from various factors, including academics, extracurricular activities, family expectations, and relationships with peers. We hope that Seedling will assist students facing depression or stress and help them balance their responsibilities with a happy, healthy life. </p>

<p> Team Parallax is a company started by five high school students, mainly meant to benefit the community while using the profit made to better our services.

Profit will be used to research and develop new products and improve existing ones in order to support our goals. Our mission is to improve the wellbeing of those with mental health issues or those who need a little push by providing them with the platform to cope with the struggles they face. </p> </div>
